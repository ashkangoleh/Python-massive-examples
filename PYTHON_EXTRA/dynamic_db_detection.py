# If the incoming databases are being created from outside your Python script, you can modify the script as follows:

# Connect to the DBMS using a suitable Python library such as psycopg2 or sqlalchemy.
# Continuously query the DBMS to get a list of existing databases.
# Compare the list of existing databases with the list from the previous query to determine if a new database has been created.
# If a new database has been created, connect to it and perform any necessary operations.
# Here's an example using psycopg2:

# python
# Copy code
import psycopg2
import time

def check_for_new_db(conn, existing_dbs):
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute("SELECT datname FROM pg_database")
    current_dbs = [db[0] for db in cur.fetchall()]
    new_dbs = set(current_dbs) - set(existing_dbs)
    return new_dbs

conn = psycopg2.connect("host=localhost user=postgres password=secret")
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute("SELECT datname FROM pg_database")
existing_dbs = [db[0] for db in cur.fetchall()]
while True:
    new_dbs = check_for_new_db(conn, existing_dbs)
    if new_dbs:
        for db_name in new_dbs:
            # Connect to the new database and perform any necessary operations
            print(f"New database detected: {db_name}")
            existing_dbs.append(db_name)
    time.sleep(5) # wait for 5 seconds before checking for new databases again

conn.close()
# This code will continuously query the PostgreSQL DBMS on the local machine to check for newly created databases. If a new database is detected, it will print a message indicating the name of the new database. The time.sleep function is used to control the frequency at which the script checks for new databases.
